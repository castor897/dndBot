# dndBot

This is a dnd bot I made for playing dnd in discord. The bot can roll d20,d12,d10,d6 and give the user a random number.
Here are the commands for the bot:
!d20 - rolls a d20 dice and gives the user a random number between 1 and 20
!d12 - rolls a d12 dice and gives the user a random number between 1 and 12
!d10 - rolls a d10 dice and gives the user a random number between 1 and 10
!d6 - rolls a d6 dice and gives the user a random number between 1 and 6
!h - shows the user a list of commands for the dndBot

How to setup:
To use this bot you have to create a discord bot through the discord dev portal and then copy paste the token into the code where it says token here.
Make sure you are using python3.8 at least, when the bot is online the bot will say in the terminal "Bot is online". To keep the bot online and working
this python program has to be on at all times, I recommend using a old computer just for this or a vps.
